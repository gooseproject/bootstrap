[hub]

## ConfigParser style config file, similar to ini files
## http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html
##
## Note that multiline values can be set by indenting subsequent lines
## (which means you should not indent regular lines)

## Basic options ##
DBName = {{ db_name }}
DBUser = {{ db_user }}
DBHost = {{ db_host }}
#DBPass = example_password
KojiDir = /mnt/koji


##  Kerberos authentication options  ##

# AuthPrincipal = kojihub@EXAMPLE.COM
# AuthKeytab = /etc/koji.keytab
# ProxyPrincipals = kojihub@EXAMPLE.COM
## format string for host principals (%s = hostname)
# HostPrincipalFormat = compile/%s@EXAMPLE.COM

## end Kerberos auth configuration

##  SSL client certificate auth configuration  ##
#note: ssl auth may also require editing the httpd config (conf.d/kojihub.conf)

## the client username is the common name of the subject of their client certificate
DNUsernameComponent = CN
## separate multiple DNs with |
# ProxyDNs = /C=US/ST=Massachusetts/O=Example Org/OU=Example User/CN=example/emailAddress=example@example.com
ProxyDNs = {{ proxy_dns }}

## end SSL client certificate auth configuration



##  Other options  ##
LoginCreatesUser = On
KojiWebURL = {{ kojiweb_url }}
# The domain name that will be appended to Koji usernames
# when creating email notifications
#EmailDomain = example.com
EmailDomain = {{ email_domain }}
# whether to send the task owner and package owner email or not on success.  this still goes to watchers
NotifyOnSuccess = False
## Disables all notifications
DisableNotifications = True

## Extended features
## Support Maven builds
# EnableMaven = False
## Support Windows builds
# EnableWin = False

## Koji hub plugins
## The path where plugins are found
# PluginPath = /usr/lib/koji-hub-plugins
## A space-separated list of plugins to load
# Plugins = echo

## If KojiDebug is on, the hub will be /very/ verbose and will report exception
## details to clients for anticipated errors (i.e. koji's own exceptions --
## subclasses of koji.GenericError).
# KojiDebug = On

## Determines how much detail about exceptions is reported to the client (via faults)
## Meaningful values:
##   normal - a basic traceback (format_exception)
##   extended - an extended traceback (format_exc_plus)
##   anything else - no traceback, just the error message
## The extended traceback is intended for debugging only and should NOT be
## used in production, since it may contain sensitive information.
# KojiTraceback = normal

## These options are intended for planned outages
# ServerOffline = False
# OfflineMessage = temporary outage
# LockOut = False
## If ServerOffline is True, the server will always report a ServerOffline fault (with
## OfflineMessage as the fault string).
## If LockOut is True, the server will report a ServerOffline fault for all non-admin
## requests.
